Description: # [Py](#)thon [Pse](#)udocode Compiler
        
        ## Introduction
        
        PsPse is a interpreted compiler for teaching purposes.
        
        Features:
        
        * Compile codes in AS-Level Computer Science Syllabus
        * Portable with no environemt requirements
        * Available in Windows and Linux
        * Continuously developing
        
        I am a senior high student learning A2 Computer Science currently, and I am new to compilers. Feel free to raise issues or contribute.

        ## Why?
        
        Pseudocode is used to express ideas without truly writing code. However,
        
        * AS-Level has specific grammar for this language
        * AS-Level International Test marks based on the grammar
        * There is no compiler for it, and there is no way to test it or execute it.
        
        As a result, there is a clear need to write such compiler, also as a project of mine for interest. :smirk:
        
        ## Get Started
        
        First, Clone the repo in terminal:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/HankelBao/PyPse
        ```
        
        Now, you will have the PyPse folder in your current path. CD to PyPse/bin/ and you will have `pypse.bin` and `pypse.exe` under the folder.
        
        If you are using Windows, 
        
        ```
        .\pypse.exe ..\test\test.5.pse
        ```
        
        If you are using Linux, 
        
        ```
        .\pypse.bin ..\test\test.5.pse
        ```
        
        If you see the *Hello World!* message showing up just like the demo, you are ready to go!
        
        ## Usage
        
        Remember, you should always use `pypse.bin` for linux and `pypse.exe` for windows.
        
        Pseudocode File ends in **.pse**, so you should create a file with such extension for execution.
        
        Write your own pseudocode and execute it!

        ## Contributing
        
        If you want to see the debug info for the compiler, call the command with *--debug*
        
        For example
        
        ```
        .\pypse.exe ..\test\test.5.pse --debug
        ```

        ## Promote
        
        Spread it around your classes if you also find the need for such a compiler!
        
        Thanks for your support.
